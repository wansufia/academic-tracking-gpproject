Academic Advising & Progress Tracking System
A web-based system for FYP students and supervisors

Brief Description
The Academic Advising & Progress Tracking System is a web application developed to support Final Year Project (FYP) students and their supervisors throughout the project lifecycle. The system offers separate login roles which are Student and Lecturer (Supervisor), with tailored dashboards and functionalities for each user type.
Students can register using preset credentials, log in to their dashboard, take notes, submit progress reports, and monitor deadlines through automated reminders. Supervisors can track student progress, review submissions, and provide structured feedback or academic advice. The system incorporates essential CRUD operations for managing users, projects, progress updates, notes, reminders, and feedback.
This platform aims to streamline academic advising, improve communication, and help ensure students stay on track with their FYP milestones.
